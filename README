This version needs the SDL 1.2 development package (for example
@code{libsdl1.2-dev} on Debian-based systems) if you want to build
with graphical output enabled.

The legacy build system requires 32-bit object files, so compiling on a
64-bit host will fail unless you use a 32-bit cross compiler (for example
`gcc -m32` with the corresponding multilib packages).
